        "Hotel reviews from sites like TripAdvisor are a treasure trove of feedback for hotels to improve themselves. However, hotel reviews on these sites only consists of lengthy word text and one overall review, which is not helpful for hotels to identify areas of improvement quickly. Reading through all the reviews is too time-consuming. <p> Instead, one way is to provide categories: Food, Cost, Cleanliness, Service etc, and based on each review, provide a sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) for the categories that the review mentioned. Then, average the sentiment over all the reviews <p>\n",

The model used is pre-trained on Restaurant data, which, like hotels, is also in the service industry. Thus, by using transfer learning, we fit the limited hotel data onto the model, which worked surprisingly well."
